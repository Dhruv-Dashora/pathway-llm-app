# pathway-llm-app
This app is still under development. The basic idea of app is to try and predict flight price between two cities around particular date.
The basic data is in the csv file. In later versions app will be able to parse and extract data from multiple sources (pdf, web).
The app will also use flight apis to find out ticket prices offered in real-time to compare with the predictions and use it to improve the predictions.
The prompt may have filters for airlines, number of stops and flight duration.
